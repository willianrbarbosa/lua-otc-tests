-- This peace of code appears to be correct and does what is expected: 
-- when the player logs out, the script checks if the storage value 1000 is equal to 1 and if so, 
-- schedules the releaseStorage() function to run at 1000 milliseconds (or 1 second). 
-- The releaseStorage() function will set the storage value 1000 to -1.

-- Changed the name of the function to resetLogoutStorage, sounds like a more descriptive name
-- Also I implemented the tab for all code for better readability
local function resetLogoutStorage(player)
    -- Set storage value 1000 to -1 when player logs out
    player:setStorageValue(1000, -1)
end

function onLogout(player)
    -- Schedule the resetLogoutStorage() function to run in 1 second
    if player:getStorageValue(1000) == 1 then
        addEvent(resetLogoutStorage, 1000, player)
    end
    return true
end
